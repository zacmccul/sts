A quick and dirty foundation for simulating slay the spire combats of enemies v enemies. Originally designed to answer the eternal question: how many Jaw Worms does it take to kill a heart? (6 at asc20, act 3 jaw worms).

Todo:
* Clean up code, finish adding docstrings, typing for everything
* Add ability to log individual battles for manual inspection, e.g. let's see the combat log from a jaw worm kill of the heart or vice versa.
* Installation instructions

Finished:
* Githook for black formatting
* Impove unit testing coverage
* Get code coverage badge working


Current supported creatures:
* Jaw Worm
* Heart
